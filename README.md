# Navitab
A speculative alternative to AviTab, drawing heavily on the original's source code and ideas.

Why? That's harder to justify. Part of the motivation was to be able to do some more risky and disruptive
changes that might not be justified in an actively-used product. For example:

- changing the build system to follow more modern CMake practices
- upgrade some of the external libraries to the latest versions
- play around with the UI design to improve usable screen space
- change some internal structuring to assist with MSFS porting
