# Curl library for carrying out client-side URL transfers, used to fetch
# map tiles, charts, docs, etc.

# Curl library has some external dependencies which are not part of the MSVC build
# environment, so these may eventually need to be added here. Currently it means the
# MSVC build of curl might not support all the protocols, but that may only be an
# issue for a small subset of downloads (TBD!)
