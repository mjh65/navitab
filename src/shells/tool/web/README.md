This version of Navitab is similar to the MSFS panel server, except that the
simulation interface is the mock simulation. The UI window interface is done
through a mini-web-server, providing PNG images of the current canvas to a web
client which is also running some JS to do local implementation of the toolbar,
modebar, doodler, and pop-up keypad.
